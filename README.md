# Packet Batch (Tests)
## Description
A small repository that includes YAML configurations for Packet Batch.

It is worth noting that TCP cooked socket support (via the `usesocket` setting under YAML) is **only supported** in the standard version due to `AF_PACKETSv3` support.

I would suggest looking at the Packet Batch Common [repository](https://github.com/Packet-Batch/PB-Common) if you haven't already!
